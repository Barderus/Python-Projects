## My To do list so I don't lose track

1. Finish setting up magic spells
   * White Spells
   * Blue Spells
   * Green Spells

2. Add magic selection to the battle and make sure spells can be casted properly

3. Add pep up (like DQ11) and range of damage for both physical and magical attacks

3. Add items to the game.

4. Add 3 rooms to the game.
   * Room 1 = First Battle (Gain some random items)
   * Room 2 = Second Battle (Gain some more random items)
   * Room 3 = Boss Fight
