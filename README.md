# Projects
## Projects ideas that I want to complete before the end of my school year.
I separated them into two categories: Computer Science and Data Science since I will be graduatting with a minor in DS,
I thought it would be a good idea to do at least one or two projects.

- **Computer Science:** 
    - Wordle solver
    - Sudoku solver
    - Pokemon battle
    - Picture identifier
    - Banking app
    - Tarantulas and isopods Management App
    - App to find where movies are streaming
    - App that calculates the time vs money to get somewhere (look at trains, gas price, airplane, bike, etc)
    - Something related to birding?
    - Enrichment tracker (?)

- **Data Science:**
  - Recipe suggestions based on what you have and order your grocery list
  - CO2 emissions and its correlation with temperature
  - Music suggestions based on your pokemon type/favorite Pokemons
  - Model that can recommend songs/artists from the past into the present
Example: Songs that are very similar to Elvis in the present
  App that predicts who will win next league of Legends tournament
